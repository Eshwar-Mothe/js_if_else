        Income <= 2,50,000: No tax
        
        Income > 2,50,000 and <= 5,00,000: 5% of the amount exceeding 2,50,000
        
        Income > 5,00,000 and <= 10,00,000: 12,500 + 20% of the amount exceeding 5,00,000
        
        Income > 10,00,000: 1,12,500 + 30% of the amount exceeding 10,00,000
        
        
        Requirements:
        
        Input: A variable representing income
        
        Output: Total tax payable

        2. Shipping Cost Based on Weight and Destination
        
        Problem:
        Write a program that calculates the shipping cost for a parcel based on its weight and destination:
        
        Weight <= 1kg:
        
        Local: $5
        
        National: $8
        
        International: $15
        
        
        Weight > 1kg and <= 5kg:
        
        Local: $10
        
        National: $15
        
        International: $30
        
        
        Weight > 5kg and <= 10kg:
        
        Local: $20
        
        National: $25
        
        International: $50
        
        
        Weight > 10kg:
        
        Local: $30
        
        National: $35
        
        International: $70
        
        
        
        Requirements:
        
        Input: Two variables for weight and destination
        
        Output: The total shipping cost

        3. Electricity Bill Calculation Based on Usage
        
        Problem:
        Write a program to calculate the electricity bill based on the number of units consumed:
        
        Units <= 100: $1 per unit
        
        Units > 100 and <= 300: $1 per unit for the first 100 units + $1.5 per unit for the next 200 units
        
        Units > 300: $1 per unit for the first 100 units + $1.5 per unit for the next 200 units + $2 per unit beyond 300
        
        
        Requirements:
        
        Input: A variable representing the number of units consumed
